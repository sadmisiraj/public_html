                <p class="fs-6"><strong>Pair Commissions: </strong> Pair Commission is a core component of the Binary MLM Plan. It is based on the pairing of members in your binary structure. In this system, you are usually paid a commission when there is a balanced pair of members on your left and right legs (typically referred to as the power leg and weak leg).
                    The pairing may be defined in various ways, such as matching the sales volume, points, or product purchases of the members on both legs. When a pair is created, you receive a commission, and the system typically flushes the excess or unpaired volume.</p>
